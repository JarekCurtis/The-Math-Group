# The-Math-Group
Welcome to my own version of The-Math-Group wiki! This one is focused on pure maths aka "Group 2" from the original version of The-Math-Group. Everything here is not my original compilation but rather a recompilation, with lots of the original wording preserved and parts edited for clarity. In the words of the original on the purpose of the following cirriculum: **"this is a much longer endeavor intended for those who want to also relearn their math and form a solid base but instead you go through the foundations of math and learn what math is built up on... logic, set theory, etc. It takes around 1-2 years to finish this curriculum but if you do you should be able to pick up any math book you want and learn from it with ease."**

# Curriculum:

* Read **“The Three Crises in Mathematics: Logicism, Intuitionism and Formalism” by Ernst Snapper** (<a href="http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/22/Allendoerfer/1980/0025570x.di021111.02p0048m.pdf">Source</a>)

* Read **"Introduction to Formal Logic" by Peter Smith**

* Read **“Dispute over Infinity Divides Mathematicians” by Natalie Wolchover** (<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/infinity-logic-law/">sourced from Scientific American</a> but you can also find it at Quanta Magazine)

* Read **“Introduction to Set Theory” by Karel Hrbacek and Thomas Jech** (<a href="http://www.unalmed.edu.co/%7Ejmramirezo/Jorge_Ramirez/Conjuntos_files/introdiction-to-set-Theory.pdf">Source</a>). Don’t get too bogged down with this, just enjoy the read and move on when you feel ready. Go back to it when the situation arises that you need it to move forward with math.

* Read **“Conceptual Mathematics: A first introduction to categories” by F. William Lawvere and Stephen H. Schanuel** (<a href="http://fef.ogu.edu.tr/matbil/eilgaz/kategori.pdf">Source</a>). Don’t read it all the way through; just enjoy it until you get tired of it. Go back to it as you work through math and see how it all fits together.

* Read everything in **Prof. Wayne Aitken's CSUSM Spring 2009 Math 378 course notes (Ch. 0 - 10)** folder (<a href="http://public.csusm.edu/aitken_html/m378/">Source</a>). We've saved them before they’re potentially taken down. Work through these excellent notes as if they were a textbook. Learn it all as if you were given the Sports Almanac in Back to the Future series in 1985; it’s literally that good. **This is the most important step in this entire list; if you do nothing else, at least do this.** Supplement with **"How to Prove It: A Structured Approach" by Daniel J. Velleman**.

* Read **“Principles of Mathematics” by Bertrand Russell** (<a href="http://elearning.uokerbala.edu.iq/pluginfile.php/21627/mod_resource/content/0/Bertrand%20Russell%20-%20Principles%20of%20Mathematics.pdf">Source</a>). Like the books on Set and Category Theory, read it but not like your life depended on it. If you mastered Smith’s book on Formal Logic, you will master this book too, and it will help you clarify things that seem like magic in mathematics. But know that Russell’s work isn’t the end all be all.

* Learn about non-classical logic. Question the law of excluded middle; think for yourself — does it make sense to you? Do you believe physical reality follows this rule? This is a big moment. It will decide whether you want to be an intuitionist or a formalist (built on top of the logicist framework). All of formal mathematics from this point on, including calculus, is built on the idea that the law of excluded middle is right. In fact, even the books by Smith and Prof. Aitken, as well as all of Set Theory assume this notion. Maybe just let this question simmer in the back of your mind and continue to read about more mathematics. Don’t forget that it’s still a valid philosophical question. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics#Foundational_crisis">Some background</a>)

* Read **"Principles of Mathematical Analysis" by Walter Rudin** aka "Baby Rudin"; accompany this read with lecture notes and free online midterm exams from Stanford’s Math 19, 20 and 21 and Harvard’s Math 1a, 1b and 112 in the **Practice Exams** folder. You should realize that Prof. Aitken’s lecture notes should make this transition seamless. After all, his notes could could well be called “Analysis of the Natural Numbers, Arithmetic and Algebra.” He even covers some real and complex number stuff, so when you see Baby Rudin, you should be in a very, very solid position to blow this material out of the water. Do it. When you have, congratulations, you’ve probably surpassed the majority of college graduates understanding of mathematics. But don’t stop here, you need to understand more than just two dimensional mathematics after all.

* Read **"A First Course in Topology" by James Munkres**. This should be tons of review by this point. You should recognize things from set theory, real analysis and logic popping up everywhere. This should be an easy A, and it comes in handy as you move up to more than two dimensions.

* Now, you have options. You can now start Abstract Algebra, or multivariable mathematics with linear algebra. This is how things get extended beyond two dimensions, making use of everything you learned up to this point; it will act as if your limbs were extended further. In order for this learning experience to truly feel this way, you need to do Abstract Algebra first. So I’m just going to say, do Abstract Algebra now. Go ahead and read **"Topics in Abstract Algebra" by I.N. Herstein** first. Follow it up with **"Algebra" by Michael Artin**. Artin is more hand wavy, but covers more material, so I think it makes a lot more sense to go in this order. Both are excellent books.

* Read **"Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus and Differential Forms" by Hubbard and Hubbard**. Much like Rudin should have flowed seamlessly from Aitken, Hubbard and Hubbard should go down like lemonade to you now. Accompany your reading with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5I-Eyk8l9FHdJUd9UujGcvumjCFPHbrd">Math 3500/3510 lecture series (an honors class covering multivariable math) by Ted Shifrin on youtube</a>. Further supplement Hubbard and Hubbard with either: 1) "Linear Algebra" by Steven Levendosky, 2) **"Vector Calculus" by Marsden and Tromba** or 3) "Multivariable Mathematics: Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus and Manifolds" by Ted Shifrin. It’s hard to say which is better. Don’t waste money buying all 3. Personally, I’d probably buy Shifrin based on his lecture videos, and also because Marsden and Tromba is on Scribd. You can pickup Levendosky cheaply on amazon ($30 or less). If that sounds like a super good deal, buy it. It’s excellent.

* Go ahead and solidify your Linear Algebra because it’s really important from now on. Have "Linear Algebra done Right" by Sheldon Axler at hand and take Berkeley’s Math 110 midterm and final exams (<a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~nadler/110fall2013">Fall 2013 exams</a>) before opening Axler’s book (you can find them online easily enough if you want more to test against). If they are easy for you, just scan the table of contents of Axler and read anything that sounds unfamiliar; skip the rest unless you want to read it. If you want to do the HW from 110 as well, then (optionally) pick up a copy of "Linear Algebra" by Friedberg, Insel and Spence. Don’t spend too much time on this. Just make sure you have Hubbard and Hubbard, and Math 3500/3510 down really well. Breeze through Axler to patch up anything not covered in Abstract Algebra and Multivariable Mathematics.

* Now you have gotten to the point where you can go online and buy any math book that interests you, and you should be able to just learn it with ease. Explore whatever you want. Algebraic topology, differential geometry, differential topology, complex analysis, physics, cryptology, computer science, statistics, anything at all. My advice, try to learn about multilinear algebra and tensors in depth. I don’t know why, but multivariable math textbooks don’t teach it, in fact the only school that I know of that teaches it is Stanford in their Math 52h class. The sky is the limit man! Have fun!
